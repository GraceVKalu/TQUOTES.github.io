    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <h1> Who I Am </h1>
    <p>My Name is Grace and I love fashion beucase it's another form of art.
      Expressing yourself as an individual person is important in society and
      that should never come with a huge price. The way you put an outfit
      together portrays the type of person you are in a way. Since I love
      shopping but hate spending $50 for a hoodie that is popular, I've built
      this company to produce good quality clothing for a resonable price as 
      well as insuring quality.</p>
